        <p><em>My Self Taught <strong>Software Development Journey</strong></em></p>
        <p>I am a plumber by trade, however, I would'nt say I have a passion for plumbing. Computers, software. apps, and creativity is where my passion is. This passion is why I am persuing a new career in software development. I love computers, I
          love problem solving, and creating whatever I can think of. This is something that I have wanted to do for as long as I can remember, however, I could never afford schooling or bootcamps. I am married with three children, and unfortunately
          this is a dream that had to take a back seat due to finacial strains. I am a firm believer that if you want something bad enough you have to do whatever it takes to obtain it. That brings me to my journey as a self taught software
          developer.</p>
